  App will be able to summarize any file that is downloaded.

  App should wait for a user to click download (does Courtlistener do this?), then save the file, and use the API to submit the file to an LLM to summarize

# courtlistener-download

Browser extension to download all files related to one docket entry on CourtListener.

[Download for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/courtlistener-multiple-pd/mfhmcnemllapebbjmgjidncbimcnhkie) â€¢ [Download for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/courtlistener-multi-downloader/)

---

On CourtListener docket pages, where there are multiple PDF documents attached to one entry and available on CourtListener, the extension adds a button to download all PDFs attached to that entry. They will be downloaded as a .zip file, and renamed to match the human-readable filenames instead of CourtListener's style.

If you have the [RECAP extension](https://free.law/recap) installed (and you should!!), this extension will also work on PACER:
