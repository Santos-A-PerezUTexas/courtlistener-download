# courtlistener-download

Chrome extension to download all files related to one docket entry on CourtListener.

[![Available on the Chrome Web Store](./chrome-badge.png)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/courtlistener-multiple-pd/mfhmcnemllapebbjmgjidncbimcnhkie)

On CourtListener docket pages, where there are multiple PDF documents attached to one entry and available on CourtListener, the extension adds a button to download all PDFs attached to that entry. They will be downloaded as a .zip file, and renamed to match the human-readable filenames instead of CourtListener's style.

If you have the [RECAP extension](https://free.law/recap) installed (and you should!!), this extension will also work on PACER:
